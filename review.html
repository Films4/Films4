								<div class="movie-title"><a href="single.html">Chucky</a></div>
							  <p>It's pleasantly surprising that this TV series fully encompasses the entire Child's Play movie history into it, And they pay a lot of attention to paying homage to what came before as well as the attention to detail for continuity's sake. They also touch on a lot of deeper family and social topics than the movies ever could.... And they seem to seamlessly do it without sacrificing the horror aspect of the Child's Play theme. It's perfectly twisted the way they get you emotionally involved by fleshing out all these characters in the show</p>

								<div class="movie-title"><a href="single.html">Conjuring&nbsp;</a></div>
							  <p>after waiting years for this film i am so glad they kept the same magic and power of the main conjuring films even with swapping directors and is probably my favourite film in this universe. it was nice seeing this movie take a different direction and storyline by moving from a haunted house movie to an investigation. the movie is shot so beautifully as well as the director building up tension and suspense leading up to the scares sometimes flawlessly. this movie is also strongly upheld by its strong cast surround Patrick and Vera, who has always deliver an amazing and heart warming performance</p>

								<div class="movie-title"><a href="single.html">Titanic&nbsp;</a></div>
							  <p>This is the most amazing movie that a film maker has brought to the world It is a timeless tale that has touched the hearts of audience members for over 25 years The film shows to the audience the grandeur and prestige of the S.S Titanic. One of the most talked about and anticipated mechanical works of it's day Scenes of breathtaking cinematography of the magnificent ship takes the breath away, more so the enthusiasm and optimism of those on board, feeling like the luckiest people alive as they set off for the very publicised voyage to America&nbsp;</p>

								<p>It hasn't been very long since I started watching spn. I finished it within 4months and I got so addicted to it that I started rewatching it after finishing and now it has been almost eight months and I love each and every last detail of this show even more. This show changed my life. It made me realise what was actually missing in my life. It made me realise that 'Family don't end with blood but it doesn't start there either' It helped me through a very tough time in my life. It gave me the strength I needed to get through the day. It introduced me to three wonderful and the most beautiful people in the whole wide world</p>

								<figure class="movie-poster"><img src="../../../badboys.jpg" alt="#"></figure>
								<div class="movie-title"><a href="single.html">Bad boys</a></div>
							  <p>really loves this film. It is one of the best action-packed, comedy film of all time. And also it is one of the best film of Will Smith one of the greatest actor of Hollywood of all time. The thing which I loves the most the confusion between Mike and Marcus to save Judi from there enemies after the death of Girl Decoy. At first I thought that Mike (Will Smith) and Marcus (Martin Lawrence) were bad guys but then I found that they are police officers of Miami. I loved the comedy scene in which Marcus' wife found him with Judi in a flat and I also loved right after the action scene. The climax and the airport was beyond of my words. I the most funny scene was when Marcus went to his house to see what Mike and his wife were doing. And the most emotional scene was when Girl Decoy assassinated. And more sad full moment was the expression of Mike seeing his girlfriend's dead body.&nbsp;</p>

								<div class="movie-title"><a href="single.html">Wednesday</a></div>
								<p>Addams family tale that explores Wednesday’s schooling at a unique school for misfits which includes those with supernatural powers. Whilst there she goes on a series of adventures whilst trying to unravel the mystery of a monster loose in the woods, visions from an ancestor, as well as several other mini story lines that weave together to build a bigger reveal. Again, this would be the opposite of the sort of thing I’d find engaging, but it’s done fantastically. The Director keeps the story building simple, the character arcs endearing and the pay offs satisfying. The casting is excellent, and such is the level of affection built for all characters you actually find yourself fond of a disembodied hand. Cracking stuff, well worthy of your time.&nbsp;</p>

								<figure class="movie-poster"><img src="../../../gg.jpg" alt="#"></figure>
								<div class="movie-title"><a href="single.html">Ginny and Georgia</a></div>
								<p>This is a great show overall. The writing, the actors, filming oh my! Georgia’s actress (Brianne Howey) is amazing, truly a star. Brianne Howey has some of the best acting I’ve seen in a long time. The two actresses are beautiful, yet talented underrated, underestimated forces to be reckon with. Yes, there are heavy issues so this show is surely made for young adult to older audience. I’m 22 and I believe it’s a show on Netflix that doesn’t make me feel like I’m watching a kids show/uncomfortable. This show has real writing, real emotion, more realistic (high school situations). Shows like euphoria/outer banks is cool and all! But this show feels more authentic. Even took me back to when I was in high school watching Ginny’s life, it’s fun! Georgia story line is very edge of the seat, I love the entertainment, energy, the actress let alone! Ginny and Georgia turned into a favorite from the first or second episode..</p>

								<figure class="movie-poster"><img src="../../../the terminal.webp" alt="#"></figure>
							<div class="movie-title"><a href="single.html">The Terminal</a></div>
							<p>found this movie uniquely heartwarming. Tom Hanks, as usual, does an astounding job playing the lead role. When I found this movie it was tagged as a drama/romance which partly made sense although there is not nearly as much romance as I thought would transpire in the film. In my opinion this is a good thing because I get tired of the predictability of romance movies and this movie kept me on my toes much more. I don't want to spoil anything so I will simply say that Mr. Navorski's (Tom Hanks) reason for being in New York seems very odd but to me seems like the kind of odd that happens in real life. The movie ends with the satisfaction that one can only receive after arriving victorious at the end of a long uphill battle. I believe that this film is a must watch as I believe that it is truly and undeniably unique and excellent in its own way.</p>

								<figure class="movie-poster"><img src="../../../home.webp" alt="#"></figure>
								<div class="movie-title"><a href="single.html">Home alone&nbsp;</a></div>
								<p>The idea of an 8-year-old boy who is mistakenly left home alone by his family and has to protect the house from two bumbling burglars is pretty entertaining. Memorable moments such as the Angels with Filthy Souls film-within-a-film, the entire House defence sequence or Kevin messing around the home after realising his family left. Solid acting from most of the cast with Macaulay Culkin doing a great performance as Kevin McCallister.&nbsp;</p>

								<div class="movie-title"><a href="single.html">The flash&nbsp;</a></div>
							  <p>The Flash is a highly entertaining and thought-provoking film that is sure to please fans of the character and the DC Universe. The story is complex and emotionally resonant, as Barry Allen grapples with the consequences of his time travel and the choices he makes to save the world. Michael Keaton is excellent as Batman, bringing a new level of depth and gravitas to the role. The supporting cast is also strong, with Ezra Miller giving a charismatic performance as Barry Allen and Sasha Calle making a great impression as Supergirl.&nbsp;</p>

								  <p><a href="single.html"> Talk to me</a></p>
							  </div>
							  <p>Talk to me - Even though I'm not a big fan of horror movies, this one was one of the best movies I've seen. It's about a group of teenagers who discover how to conjure spirits with an embalmed hand. What started as a high-stakes party game quickly becomes dangerous. Unlike other horror movies, it doesn't rely on only jump scares to be scary. It had an amazing plot twist at the end. 10/10.</p>

							  <p>Well, you can say i started liking cars more because of this movie. This movie made me feel like i was a part of the car community. There was a guy named Brian. He was into cars. He raced and raced again and again. He always got into trouble. One day his mom decided to send him to Tokyo. He thought his life was going to be boring. But then he found his car people. He started hanging out with them.. learnt to drift and beat the villains. I totally recommand this movie. The best for car people!.</p>

							  <p>Legally blonde - One of the most iconic movies of all time. Although its target audience is young teen girls, its a movie that can be enjoyed by everyone. Its a perfect mix of serious and funny, with a satisfying revenge at the end. I totally recommend this movie. 10/10.</p>

							  <p>Such a great movie! One of my favorites! The jumpscares actually got me because I wasn’t expecting them. I love how the action happened right at the beginning of the movie instead of there being a slow steady buildup to the climax. Also, everything that happened in the movie actually MADE SENSE. Everything that happens at the beginning of the movie is very important for later on, and even Evelyn, the librarian lady, who I thought was just going to be an unimportant side character, came through and was a very important role later. The movie connected all the mystery and connected the ties amazingly.</p>

							  <p>This film really surprised me to be honest! I found it to be a breath of fresh air!! I am not familiar with the character at all so I had no idea what to expect from this film to be honest? However this was definitely one of the few MCU films in 2021 that I was genuinely intrigued to see because I am a big martial arts fan!!! I also wanted to see something different in the MCU? For the most part I absolutely loved this film!!&nbsp;</p>

							  <p>Chloe Zhao did an incredible job of introducing so many new characters into the MCU. I felt each character was developed perfectly, I watched this movie at home and it left me knowing them all inside and out. The diversity of this cast is also worth mentioning - it was truly refreshing to have representation from minority groups in each character. I fell in love with each character (especially Thena...) and cannot wait to see where the eternals are taken in the future of the MCU&nbsp;</p>

								<div class="movie-title"><a href="single.html">Toy Story</a></div>
							  <p>One of the most incredible, amazing, fantastic and wonderful Disney classics I've ever grown up with. The characters, the mystery, the effects, the story, the musical score, the unforgettable songs, the laughs, everything this classic film offers to anyone and everyone still never gets old. Clearly in this film my favorite character is Woody mostly because one of my favorite things about him is that he really thinks like only a true friend would because only a true friend will never give up on you and will always be there for you no matter what happens.</p>

							  <p>Personally, I really liked the role of Baymax. There is no doubt that he is a robot and doesn't have human-like emotions, but his character is dedicated to human feelings and nature to the maximum extent. He is compassionate, heart-warming, understanding, empathetic and overall, "an amazing healthcare robot". Throughout the movie, his character develops from being just a simple robot to a robot who knows how to do karate, fly in the sky like an Iron-Man and learn such extraordinary traits, such as "Sacrificing for the sake of others".&nbsp;</p>

							  <p>5/5 When "Finding Nemo" came out twenty years ago, critics, families, every person was raving about it with so much praise, and it won an Oscar for best animated feature of 2003. "Finding Nemo" was one of my favorite childhood movies growing up, ever since I was four. Does it still hold up today? Should it remain as one of my all-time favorites? As an adult, I was remembering everything that caught me; from the scenes, to the music score, and to the voice acting, it's one of the most memorable movies for my sensibilities..</p>

							  <p>Hotel Transylvania I thoroughly enjoyed Hotel Transylvania 1! The movie is filled with colorful and imaginative characters, hilarious jokes, and heartwarming moments. The voice acting is top-notch, with Adam Sandler, Selena Gomez, and Andy Samberg bringing their A-game to the table. The animation is also incredibly well-done, with vivid colors and smooth movements that are sure to captivate viewers. What I love most about this movie is its unique take on classic monsters like Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Mummy. Instead of being scary, they're lovable and relatable characters that you can't help but root for. The story is also engaging and keeps you entertained from start to finish. Overall, I highly recommend Hotel Transylvania 1 for anyone looking for a fun and entertaining family movie. Whether you're a kid or an adult, there's something in this movie for everyone. So grab some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the ride                                                     page 2 !&nbsp;</p>
